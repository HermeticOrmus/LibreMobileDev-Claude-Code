# Advanced Learning Path - Mobile Development

## Overview

This advanced path introduces Mobile Development concepts and practices, building from fundamentals to practical application. Each module combines theory with hands-on exercises using Claude Code plugins.

## Prerequisites

- Completed intermediate path\n- Published an app to a store\n- Solid testing practices

## Modules

### Module 1: Performance Optimization

#### Concepts
- Launch time optimization\n- Memory management\n- Battery and network efficiency\n- UI rendering performance\n- Profiling with DevTools

#### Hands-On Exercise
Using the relevant plugin, practice the core concepts from this module. Start with a simple project and gradually increase complexity.

```
# Example workflow
1. Set up your environment
2. Create a minimal working example
3. Iterate and improve
4. Document what you learned
```

#### Key Takeaways
- Understand the fundamental concepts of Performance Optimization
- Know when and why to apply these concepts
- Be able to create basic implementations

### Module 2: Mobile CI/CD

#### Concepts
- Fastlane automation\n- Code signing and provisioning\n- Automated testing pipelines\n- Beta distribution\n- App store submission automation

#### Hands-On Exercise
Build on Module 1 by integrating more advanced concepts. Focus on quality and best practices rather than speed.

```
# Example workflow
1. Review your Module 1 work
2. Identify improvement opportunities
3. Apply new patterns and techniques
4. Validate results
```

#### Key Takeaways
- Integrate multiple concepts effectively
- Apply best practices consistently
- Evaluate and improve existing work

---

### Module 3: Architecture at Scale

#### Concepts
- Clean Architecture for mobile\n- Feature-based modularization\n- Dependency injection\n- Offline-first architecture\n- Multi-module app design

#### Hands-On Exercise
Combine all concepts from this path into a comprehensive project that demonstrates your understanding.

```
# Example workflow
1. Plan your comprehensive project
2. Apply all learned patterns
3. Test and validate thoroughly
4. Present and document results
```

#### Key Takeaways
- Synthesize concepts across modules
- Make informed decisions about approaches
- Create production-quality implementations

## Assessment

To verify mastery of this advanced path:
- [ ] Complete all three module exercises
- [ ] Build a project combining concepts from all modules
- [ ] Review your work against the patterns in the skill files
- [ ] Identify areas for further learning

## Next Steps

You've mastered mobile development. Consider exploring native development (Swift/Kotlin) for deeper platform integration.

## Recommended Plugins

Explore the plugins directory for specialized agents, commands, and skills relevant to each module. Use `/help` within Claude Code to discover available commands.
