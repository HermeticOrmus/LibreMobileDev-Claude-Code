# Intermediate Learning Path - Mobile Development

## Overview

This intermediate path introduces Mobile Development concepts and practices, building from fundamentals to practical application. Each module combines theory with hands-on exercises using Claude Code plugins.

## Prerequisites

- Completed the beginner path\n- A working Flutter app\n- Basic understanding of state management

## Modules

### Module 1: State Management Patterns

#### Concepts
- Provider, Riverpod, BLoC comparison\n- Reactive programming concepts\n- Global vs local state\n- State persistence\n- State debugging and DevTools

#### Hands-On Exercise
Using the relevant plugin, practice the core concepts from this module. Start with a simple project and gradually increase complexity.

```
# Example workflow
1. Set up your environment
2. Create a minimal working example
3. Iterate and improve
4. Document what you learned
```

#### Key Takeaways
- Understand the fundamental concepts of State Management Patterns
- Know when and why to apply these concepts
- Be able to create basic implementations

### Module 2: API Integration & Platform Code

#### Concepts
- REST API integration patterns\n- Authentication (OAuth, JWT)\n- Platform channels (iOS/Android)\n- Device features (camera, GPS, sensors)\n- Push notifications setup

#### Hands-On Exercise
Build on Module 1 by integrating more advanced concepts. Focus on quality and best practices rather than speed.

```
# Example workflow
1. Review your Module 1 work
2. Identify improvement opportunities
3. Apply new patterns and techniques
4. Validate results
```

#### Key Takeaways
- Integrate multiple concepts effectively
- Apply best practices consistently
- Evaluate and improve existing work

### Module 3: Testing & Quality

#### Concepts
- Widget testing\n- Integration testing\n- Golden tests for UI\n- Code coverage\n- Accessibility testing

#### Hands-On Exercise
Combine all concepts from this path into a comprehensive project that demonstrates your understanding.

```
# Example workflow
1. Plan your comprehensive project
2. Apply all learned patterns
3. Test and validate thoroughly
4. Present and document results
```

#### Key Takeaways
- Synthesize concepts across modules
- Make informed decisions about approaches
- Create production-quality implementations
