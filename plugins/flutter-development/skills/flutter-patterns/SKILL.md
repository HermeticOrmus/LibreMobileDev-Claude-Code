# Flutter Patterns

A comprehensive pattern library and knowledge base for flutter-development.

## Knowledge Base

### Core Concepts
- **Fundamentals**: The foundational principles that govern flutter-development
- **Terminology**: Standard vocabulary and definitions used in the domain
- **Standards**: Industry standards and specifications that apply
- **Tools**: Common tools and frameworks used for flutter-development

### Architecture Principles
- Separation of concerns within flutter-development implementations
- Modularity and reusability of components
- Scalability considerations for growing systems
- Integration patterns with adjacent domains

### Quality Attributes
- **Correctness**: Implementations must meet functional requirements
- **Maintainability**: Code and artifacts should be easy to understand and modify
- **Performance**: Implementations should meet non-functional requirements
- **Security**: Sensitive data and operations must be properly protected

## Patterns

### Pattern 1: Structured Approach
- Start with requirements analysis
- Design before implementing
- Validate against acceptance criteria
- Document decisions and rationale

### Pattern 2: Iterative Refinement
- Begin with a minimal viable implementation
- Gather feedback early and often
- Refine based on real-world usage
- Continuously improve based on metrics

### Pattern 3: Convention Over Configuration
- Follow established conventions where they exist
- Configure only what needs to deviate from defaults
- Document any non-standard choices
- Prefer explicit over implicit behavior

### Pattern 4: Defense in Depth
- Validate at multiple levels
- Handle errors gracefully at each layer
- Provide meaningful feedback for failures
- Log important events for debugging

## Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: Premature Optimization
- Optimizing before understanding the actual bottleneck
- Adding complexity without measured need
- Sacrificing readability for marginal performance gains

### Anti-Pattern 2: Copy-Paste Without Understanding
- Duplicating code without understanding its purpose
- Propagating bugs through mechanical copying
- Missing opportunities for abstraction

### Anti-Pattern 3: Ignoring Standards
- Deviating from conventions without clear justification
- Creating inconsistency across the codebase
- Making onboarding harder for new contributors

### Anti-Pattern 4: Over-Engineering
- Building for hypothetical future requirements
- Adding abstraction layers without clear benefit
- Creating complex solutions for simple problems
